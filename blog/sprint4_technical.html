            <h1>Sprint Four Technical Blog: Problem Solving</h1>
            <p>I remember sitting in front of a computer for a couple of hours, everything looks perfect, and I even compared my code with the sample solution. For a moment I was convinced that the program I was use is for sure broken. How else would this happen? I also panic messaged my tutor trying to get someone to affirm my frustration. In the end, I found out that the only mistake in the code was an extra space that I accidentally typed in. After the space was deleted everything starts to  running smoothly. 
                I suppose problem solving is a matter of having this attention to detail in unexpected places, having patience, and try to stay within the belief that I would get there eventually. 
            </p>
            <p>Pseudocode: I am not that good that this yet, it is difficult to imagine the sequence in which the code would run without seeing it. </p>
            <p>Trying something: this is something I am constantly engaging in doing. Maybe paired with other methods such as the pseudocode and rubber duck method it would be more useful. 
            </p>
            <p>Rubber ducky method: I also think I have trouble mentally translating what happens in the code to linguistic explanation. Perhaps this is something I should be doing more. 
            </p>
            <p>Reading error messages: error messages has been helpful, but only at times where the problem the simple enough for the error message to show useful information. 
            </p>
            <p>Console.logging: I haven't used this much, it should be good thing to include in my code more.</p>
            <p>Googling: I am quite proficient in googling and finding solutions on reference sites and forums</p>
            <p>Asking your peers for help & asking coaches for help: I try to reserve this for times where the problem is too specific to find a solution on Google
            </p>
            <p>Improving your process with reflection: I always little patience for reflections, perhaps I need to come up with an alternative process of reflection that works for me.
