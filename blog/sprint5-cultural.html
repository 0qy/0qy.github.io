                <p>	I found myself to be very impatient and easily frustrated when things don’t happen smoothly. However it has been a good journey to identity those moments when it happens during foundation. Although it might not mean that I am able to halt these tendencies, awareness is already a big step forward for me. </p>
                <p>	For me, the roles of values, empathy and self awareness is important in facilitating collaboration and cooperation between minds, through recognition and knowledge of the self to that of others. </p>
                <p>The concepts of core learning have been familiar to me already, but the acts of writing them down were challenging. Perhaps this is from the feeling of performativity that I associate with this process, or perhaps it is a discomfort with vulnerability and not wanting to feel like I need to prove these to others. Thus the formality to writing things down and publishing them doesn’t sit right with me. With this said, I still think this is a valuable part of the curriculum. </p>
