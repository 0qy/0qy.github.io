                <h1>EQ & IQ</h1>
                <p>
                        EQ is a marker for Emotional Intelligence, the establishment of this concept is to stress the fact that there are multiple ways to measuring one's intelligence. Emotional intelligence is used to describe one's ability to be emotionally present, supportive, contrary to the IQ which is limited to intelligence in a rational and scientific manner. 
                </p>
                <p>
                        For me, EQ is not just about emotions but also intuition. Although I must say that in my opinion,  such binaural dualistic concepts are rather arbitrary. EQ and IQ are probably more intertwined than contradictory, all playing a part the human psyche, What they are doing are probably more similar than different. With that said, and not bracketed and put aside, I do find myself to have become a slave of my rationality. Through the journey of accumulating knowledge, critical thinking skills and reflections, what is lost is the ability to appeal to feelings.

                        Feelings here in the way that I use it is associated with intuition, emotions, a knowing that can't be expressed in language, and a settling down in the bodily state of being. The abandonment, or, stepping out of the fetishization of rationality is a liberation to me. A sense of not having to appeal to objective facts, science, mathematics, but honouring the embodied experiences of lightning bolts that is felt, that can't, or don't need to crytalise.
