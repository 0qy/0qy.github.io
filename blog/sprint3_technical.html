            <h1>Sprint Three Technical Blog: Javascript, DOM</h1>
            <h2>The differences between HTML and CSS
            </h2>
            <p>In a webpage, HTML, CSS, and Javascript work together to create one interactive entity that is the site. They all do quite different things though, HTML builds the skeleton of the website, this is where the texts were inserted, sections are made. CSS, on the other hand, don't create any additional content, but works only to stylise whatever that already exists in the HTML file. Javascript is a programming language that builds any interactive features on the page, it can talk to the different things in a HTML and CSS files, and make them do different things. 
            </p>
            <h2>Control flow and loops
            </h2>
            <p>Control flow is the order in which actions happen when a script is ran, this is like going to the pantry to grab a snack, You have to be hungry first, walk to the pantry. You want to have chips if there is chips, but if not you will settle for a piece of fruit, but if you really can't find any snacks you might gulp some milk or a spoonful of peanut butter. These things need to happen in that order, and the result of each informs the next action. 
                Loops, on the other hand, makes an action happen over and over again until a conditions is met where the computer is told to stop. An example for this could be if you are sweeping the floor, the action of sweeping is repeated until the floor is clean. 
            </p>
            <h2>The DOM</h2>        
            <p>The DOM stands for Document Object Model, is the way through which javascript is able to communicate with HTML and CSS files and makes things happen. The HTML document is organised in a particular way and all the elements in it can be grabbed (selected) and work it. To use it, you might use document.getElementById() or document.getElementsByClass to grab the different elements in the file you might want to manipulate, and through there you can do whatever you want with them with javascript. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                The differences between accessing data from arrays and objects </h2>
            <p>An array is a list that could look like: dogs['Poodles', 'Labradors', 'Great Danes']. To access data from this array, you need to first know that all arrays counting starts with 0. Therefor no.0 stands for the first item in dogs which is Poodles, 1 stands for Labradors and 2 stands for Great Danes. If you want to accessing Labradors, you would write: dogs[1].</p>
            <p>Objects on the other hand, contain a lot more data, and within which could be arrays. There are two ways to access data from objects, one is with ., and the other is with []. Your code would look like objectName.prop.value[], or objetNmae[prop][balue][].
            </p>
            <h2>Explain functions and why they are useful </h2>
            <p>Functions is a choreography that you determine in your javascript code. You can give it a name, determine the variables in this choreography, and determine what it does. It can take different variables and produce different output, and can also have nesting if else statements and loops.
