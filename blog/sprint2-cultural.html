                    Hopes and dreams for the future is that I develop proficiency in a wide range of programming languages, which would unlock a new sense freedom and possibilities in my art practice. It's also dreamy to have a marketable skill, perhaps a more viable pathway to fund my art practice than hospo jobs or CNZ funding schemes. I wanna be my own sugar daddy :P

                    I have so far relied on lightning strikes and lightbulb moments as intense short periods of motivation, and often fail in the face of the daily grind. This ends up as many unrealised ideas and unfinished projects. One thing I would like to get better at is the ability to go through with the daily grind, things like coding for an hour or two everyday before starting my day has been a helpful habit.

                        I am finishing up a year-long research project at Elam while doing this part-time foundation course, meaning I do have a lot on my plate. But the idea is to have these two big commitments feed into each other and informing each other, as virtual medium is a big part of my art practice.
