                <h1>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>
                <p>
                    It seems like the awareness of this concept of neuroplasticity might provide a different mindset when encountering difficulty in a challenging task. This understanding might just be the motivation needed to push through. A accelerationist approaching to brain. Whereas growth mindset is the belief that our brains have the abilities to constantly grow and evolve. Therefore, instead of regarding current capabilities are fixed and 'the way it is', growth mindset entails holding a more generative attitude towards difficult tasks.

                    Having been diagnosed with ADHD, I feel like there are times that I use the diagnoses as an excuse and barrier to justify not being organized, not fulfilling promises or the impulsive decision to just give up. The principals of neuroplasticity gives me a different/new way of coping with life with this disorder. A continuous process of new beginnings and growth. Perhaps what would be useful would be staying with tasks that I don't normally do or perceive as difficult/impossible. In the context of ADHD this could be training for my attention, reading and general organization.
